# Dots

This is a mini project that was inspired by a .gif that can be found at the link [here.](http://images.8tracks.com/imgix/i/002/376/989/tumblr_n73jvj0xqb1s0cmmno1_500-7375.gif?rect=0,0,500,500&q=65&fit=max&w=320&h=320)
There's also an html element that points to this but is not displayed by default.

I do not know the source of the original, I found it a couple years ago and have had it saved on my hard drive ever since. 

I DO NOT take credit fo the original image or concept. All I've done is re-implemented it using javascript and canvas. No infringment intended and I will gladly credit the original author should they ever become apparent. 

I saw it and wanted to make my own version so that I could use it as a background for an udpdated portfolio website.
I used Easel.js because I wanted a framework to take care of timing the animation loop for me, but the actual rendering is done with pure js/canvas. 

I tried to make the code as general as possible throughout development so that changing small things like the nummber of dots or the speed was just a parameter change instead of rewriting a block of code.
